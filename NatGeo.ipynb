    "The town of Hawf along Yemen’s border with Oman is as innocuous as places go—it’s a hot and dusty dryland that’s not exactly teeming with people. But on February 7 this year, that little spot must have felt like the centre of the universe to Cassie De Pecol. Dressed in a black top, billowing loose grey pants and head covered in a black shawl, there she was, exhausted yet exultant at capping 18 months and 10 days of travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "De Pecol had visited 195 countries in the world and Yemen was her 196th and final stop on this whirlwind expedition. As a fitting coda to this journey, she was welcomed into a local family’s home with food. Later, in her concluding note on her blog, she would describe that meal of fish, rice, salad and home-made sauces in glowing terms and thank those strangers whom she had trusted her life with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Touching down in every country is not impossible in today’s hyper connected times. But it’s still a daunting prospect. The 28-year-old’s feat made her the fastest American woman to do so. The caveat was that she became the fastest documented woman to accomplish this—she kept meticulous proof and records of her presence in every nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "“This project was more than just about following my dreams,” she says in an email conversation from Hong Kong. “I wanted to commit to something greater than myself.” During the trip, which cost $111,000 (approx. ₹71,60,000) to fund, De Pecol travelled solo. But more than the voyage itself, it was marshalling resources beforehand that took maximum effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "“A month turned into six, which turned into 12, which turned into 18 before I was ready to finally take off,” she says.“I thought I could get donations and grants in order to fund myself, but it took an immense amount of research and networking to figure out how I could make it happen.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At some point in the planning stage, discussions about her security took precedence. “My parents and my financial sponsors had to consider kidnap and ransom insurance and think about whether I needed military personnel to escort me into some of the more strife-torn regions,” she says. Eventually, she decided against it and set forth on the expedition.\n",
    "\n",
    "De Pecol started off from Palau, a group of islands near Guam, on July 24, 2015. In each country, she spent a few days, usually acquainting herself with the sights and culture. From conflict zones to crime-ridden pockets, no matter where she was, her instincts kept her in good stead. “In conservative cultures, I made sure to dress appropriately while in places with high crime rates, I was careful about presenting myself as a westerner with money,” she says. In North Korea, she recalls a harrowing 30 minutes when she was crossing the border. “During my time there I felt like I was walking on eggshells. At the border, the security guards held me up for half an hour because of some formality that the tour agency had not followed,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for most part, her memori|es are pleasant. The Middle East, in particular, left a lasting impression. “The people are some of the most welcoming and hospitable I’ve come across, while the landscapes are breathtaking. The food, music and history—it’s all enchanting,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal landmarks were celebrated in faraway and exotic places. When De Pecol turned 27 in June 2016, she found herself in Mongolia. This was not a birthday she would be spending with close friends or family. “For a week, I was in the wilderness, in a yurt, free of Wi-Fi and a mobile connection, all by myself,” she recalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many awe-inspiring moments throughout but she singles out being in Antarctica as the most special of them all, mainly for its unvarnished natural beauty. “Floating on the placid sea, everything felt silent. There were 30-foot waves crashing against the shore and high winds raging while I crossed Drake Passage. I was just transfixed watching penguins and sea lions, resting on icebergs,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Barring a few stray incidents, De Pecol never felt viscerally threatened or in danger. Largely because this was not the first time she had spent long stretches of her life in strange lands interacting with foreigners. In 2010, the Connecticut native took off to Europe with her brother Jason, stopping by Belgium, Germany and Switzerland among other places. While her sibling returned to normal life, De Pecol moved on to Turkey and spent the next two years couch-surfing and intermittently working in different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Travelling is a great leveller, she believes. Countries have disparate national identities and lifestyles, but the cliché that some things are universal holds true. De Pecol’s view is not for the cynics of this world. She says, “What I’ve noticed among most people in every nation I’ve travelled to is that we all want a roof over our heads, a hot meal in front of us, the ability to provide for our families and just be happy. These are the common values that unite all of us.”\n",

    "If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal or professional, it is, “I love travel.” Or some approximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I am not against travellers or those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travellers and their ilk. My submission is that “love to travel,” suggested so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In February, the month of love as endowed by our great gifting industrial complex, we are wrestling with what “love for travel” means in tangible, life-affecting terms. The early throes of discovering travel might not be too dissimilar to the beginnings of a feverish affair. A fleeting scene, sound or feeling that at first arouses, then enchants and eventually, lures us into a hypnotic state, evoking woolly-eyed reveries about what could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "This world, however, is not the most conducive for long-term passion, the kind that demands unflinching sustenance in the midst of distractions from a thousand notifications. Passion has many rivals to contend with. And in flippantly announcing travel as our first love, we are not fully considering the influence our other paramours (work, relationships or money) exert on us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travellers for life are compulsive. They have to be; there is no other existence. Climate change, marriages, deaths, protests and politics might have to take a backseat. I am reminded of a wanderlust-happy couple that discovered chinks in their relationship during a road trip through Russia. The woman, upset and distraught, offered a solution: cut the trip short to come back home and rekindle their chemistry. The man, however, wouldn’t give up Siberia, despite a chance at a do-over. Please don’t go getting any ideas about breaking hearts but for some travellers, marital bliss too has its limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In finding stories about travel as a lifetime affair, we looked for longevity. We chose accounts of love, which tempered by the prospect of actually living, may have assumed a subdued tenor. But it only took a remembrance or flicker to fan the ardour all over again. One budding artist writes of her admiration for Frida Kahlo, and a Frida-inspired pilgrimage to Mexico. One of our own staffers takes a mental journey back to the cities and countries that have bookmarked her blossoming long-distance affection while a mountaineer outlines why the solitude of the Himalayas will never fail to captivate her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Falling in love with travel is much like falling in love with a song. You wear it out until it makes you sick. But you have to be foolish and always full of song.\n",
